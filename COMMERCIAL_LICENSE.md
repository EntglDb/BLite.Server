Version: 1.0
Effective Date: February 22, 2026

This License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between Luca Fabbri ("Licensor") and the individual or legal entity purchasing the license ("Licensee").

By purchasing the Commercial License for BLite Server, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the following terms and conditions.

1. Grant of License

The Licensor hereby grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, and non-transferable license to use the BLite Server software ("Software") in accordance with the terms defined herein.

2. Ownership and Intellectual Property

The Software is licensed, not sold. The Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all associated intellectual property rights, copyrights, patents, and trademarks.

3. AGPLv3 Waiver (Indemnity)

This commercial license represents an explicit waiver of the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3).

Copyleft Indemnity: The Licensee is exempted from the obligation (stipulated in Section 13 of the AGPLv3) to make the source code of their applications or modifications to the Software available when interacting with users over a network.

Proprietary Use: The Licensee may integrate the Software into commercial and proprietary products without any obligation to release their own source code.

4. Fees, Taxes, and Duration

Subscription Fee: The license is granted subject to the payment of a fixed annual fee communicated at the time of purchase. The Licensor reserves the right to modify the Subscription Fee for any subsequent renewal term by providing the Licensee with notice at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the current term.

Taxes: The Subscription Fee is exclusive of any applicable taxes (such as VAT or sales tax). The Licensee is responsible for the payment of all such taxes.

Term: This license is valid for a period of 12 (twelve) months from the date of payment.

Renewal: Upon expiration, if the license is not renewed, the right to use the Software under these commercial terms shall cease, and the installation will automatically fall under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

5. Tracking, Verification, and Audit Rights

License Verification: The Software includes technical "heartbeat" functions that periodically communicate with the Licensor's servers to verify license validity.

Data Collection: These functions collect technical data only (Instance ID, version, license status). No data stored within the Licensee's databases will ever be accessed, collected, or transmitted.

Compliance: The Licensee agrees not to obstruct these technical verifications, as they are a requirement for the validity of the commercial indemnity.

Audit Rights: Upon written request by the Licensor (no more than once annually), the Licensee agrees to provide a written certification confirming that their use of the Software fully complies with the terms and restrictions of this Agreement.

6. Restrictions

The Licensee shall not:

Sublicense, rent, or redistribute the Software as a standalone product to third parties.

Prohibition of SaaS/DBaaS Offerings: The Licensee is strictly prohibited from using the Software to provide a commercial "Database-as-a-Service" (DBaaS), "Software-as-a-Service" (SaaS), or any similar managed cloud hosting service where the primary value proposition is the functionality of the Software itself to third parties.

Exceptions: If the Licensee wishes to offer the Software as a managed service or within a hosting environment, a specific Hosting/Partner License is required. Please contact the Licensor at info@blitedb.com for bespoke licensing terms.

Remove or alter any copyright notices or trademarks of Luca Fabbri from the original source code.

7. Warranty and Support

Warranty: The Software is provided "as is". The Licensor does not warrant that the Software will be error-free but commits to fixing critical bugs reported by commercial Licensees.

Support: The commercial license includes access to a priority email support channel for the duration of the contract.

8. Limitation of Liability and Force Majeure

Limitation of Liability: In no event shall Luca Fabbri be liable for any direct or indirect damages (including loss of data or profit) arising from the use or inability to use BLite Server, beyond the total amount of the annual fee paid.

Force Majeure: The Licensor shall not be held liable for any delay or failure in performance (including support services) resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond their reasonable control.

9. Termination

The Licensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the Licensee materially breaches any of its terms, including but not limited to the Restrictions (Section 6). Upon termination, the Licensee must immediately cease all use of the Software under these commercial terms or revert to the obligations of the AGPLv3 license.

10. General Provisions

Modifications: The Licensor reserves the right to unilaterally modify the terms of this Agreement at any time. Material changes will be communicated to the Licensee with at least 30 days' written notice. Continued use of the Software after such modifications take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Agreement. If the Licensee does not agree to the changes, their sole remedy is to terminate this Agreement.

Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect.

Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and communications.

11. Governing Law

Any dispute arising from this contract shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Venice, Italy.
